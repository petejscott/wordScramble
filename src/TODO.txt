Couple of options for dictSearch to improve performance:
1) split up dictionary, provide portions to multiple workers
  a) means that the validation step (ensuring all letters are represented in the found words) needs to be moved out of dictSearch (seems like a different responsibility, anyway).
2) assume multiple iterations might be needed, and spin up several simultaneous workers. As soon as one returns with words, cancel the others
  a) easier to accomplish, but might be more resource intensive on mobile. Might be a waste of battery life.
  
Regardless, dictSearch needs some more refactoring. Might as well start with that and then see where we are.
